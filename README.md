Here you will find the raw results for OOBS tournament #007 (the Lil Muscles Memorial Arena on Lichess on March 11, 2023) that were downloaded from Lichess through the tournament's web interface and the official public Lichess arena APIs, as well as the scripts used to generate the hour-by-hour standings from those raw results.

In the "what-everything-looked-like-before-cleanup" folder, you'll find an unaltered snapshot
of exactly what my scripts and data files looked like after I finished writing them and using them to calculate the hourly scores, but before I did any tidying / refactoring / cleanup / commenting.

In the "presentable-version" folder, you'll (eventually) find a cleaned up version of the same
scripts and data.

The former is probably better if you want to audit my work; the latter probably makes more sense if you just want to skim it / glance at it, and/or if you want to learn from it.

Cheers,
